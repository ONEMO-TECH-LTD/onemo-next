# Magnetic Grid v3.5.1 — portable three-rule engine proposal and execution contract

Status: DRAFT FOR DAN REVIEW
Source baseline: `session62-task/grid-v3.5` at `8d17780c`
Scope: architecture, code contract, proof contract, and deletion-complete cut-over plan. No implementation is authorized by this document alone.

## 10. Clone → compare → delete execution plan

Every task is one commit, compiles alone, and receives focused tests plus a real surface gate. No push/merge/publication is implied.

### T8 — Deslop close

Run re-export-aware traces and `git ls-files` before every kill. Confirm removal of:

- Voting/Centre-rules/scoring/phase sweep;
- comparison centre policies;
- old auto-flap and wrap metrics;
- placement-step/manual product controls;
- `panMM` and other zero-consumer result state;
- old cache/config/result fields;
- old test-only paths and stale claims.

Preserve only named product behavior and proof infrastructure.

## 1. Product goal

The engine is one portable three-rule driver:

1. **CENTRE** — at each candidate physical scale, derive one governed centre from that scaled shape alone, before magnets exist. Place the lattice rigidly on that centre: odd line count puts a node on it; even line count puts the gap/centering line on it. The centre may change with physical scale because the safe core/masses change; it may never change because magnets landed somewhere.
2. **WRAP** — every perimeter-belt disc touches the outline within the configured flap allowance. `0` means exact spot-edge tangency on the ruled source geometry; neither outline-source uncertainty nor size-walk quantum becomes hidden wrap tolerance. Auto flap returns the smallest allowance that makes the layout lawful.
3. **MAGNET-QUANTITY SCALING** — within each band, expose every new magnet count at its first exact contact-event scale where that count is simultaneously centred and wrapped. Scale is solved from the contact equation, never searched on a millimetre grid. Counts are unique and strictly increasing. A count first lawful in a lower band never reappears above worn loose.

There is no score, weight, blended preference, silent fallback, or “best attempt” in the production driver. When no lawful layout exists, the engine returns a typed refusal. Fixed-size/manual inspection returns measured concessions; it does not invent a product winner.

Dan's separate gravity ruling is a mechanical invariant, not a hidden fourth driver: among candidates identical on centre, wrap, count, and required allowance, vertical eliminates horizontal. If multiple candidates remain equal after gravity, the engine returns all of them; it never manufactures a winner from coordinate order.

## 2. Governing directive set

The contract must deliver all of these together:

- Build v3.5.1 as a separately selectable comparison path first.
- Treat Voting/scoring as untrusted visual comparator evidence only. Treat accepted Centre-rules centering outputs as the trusted behavioral baseline while its shared door/worker and named 2mm-ruler defects remain untrusted infrastructure. Do not modify either current path during proof.
- Use the proved centering-tab enforcement as the behavioral base: preserve/re-room its accepted centre-rule/governor/parity canon, replace only its documented corrupt measurements/shared infrastructure, prove centre equivalence first, then add Wrap and Magnet-quantity scaling.
- Enforce the three laws as code invariants, not UI descriptions.
- Make every exposed control true to its label.
- Make every concession explicit.
- Split the implementation into portable `spec → compute → logic → engine API`; UI reaches it only through a bridge.
- Prove the new path before removing v3.5.
- Once proved, remove every superseded mode, score, helper, control, cache field, result field, and stale document claim. No permanent parallel engines.

## 3. Necessity baseline — the smallest complete rebuild

### Required replacement after Dan's final proof

- The isolated Law package becomes the sole engine algorithm only after Dan's final live tests.
- Auto flap becomes a direct required-allowance calculation, not a 2mm scan.
- Manual/Free becomes inspection, not an alternative placement solver.
- Worker caching becomes bridge-owned orchestration with an executable request-sequence contract.

### Required deletion at cut-over

- Voting and old Centre-rules branches.
- All scoring weights, score functions, dominance orders, and placement sweep code.
- Placement-step control and phase search.
- `seatMarginMM`, `pressExcessMM`, old auto-flap scan, and the numeric `impliedFlapMM` API after its corrected worst-belt body is moved into the certified exact implementation.
- `positioning`, `votingOrder`, legacy `phaseStepMM`, and scoring-era persisted keys.
- `panMM`, `bestKx`, `bestKy`, and all zero-consumer registration state.
- Old `grid-origin` spec/compute/logic/door after all consumers use the canonical package.
- Every magnetic-grid authority under the existing `src/lib/grid-engine` family, but only after T0 records every tracked artifact and live consumer, Dan resolves precedence with the active v3.2 rebuild lane, kernel donors move, and consumers migrate. The contract does not pre-authorize deletion of another live lane. No second magnetic-grid authority may survive final cut-over; any proven unrelated reusable primitive moves under its actual general-purpose owner.
- Comparison UI and legacy documentation after Dan’s proof gate.

### Elements explicitly preserved

- Perimeter-belt coverage: native product behavior, not slop.
- Magnet plan/diameters: product output configuration, not a ranking force.
- Shape-source and cutout-library bench adapters.
- Legal-area/mass visualization needed to verify centre selection.
- Full-grid visualization as diagnostics; wrap is always belt-scoped.

### Canonical-root decision

`src/lib/magnetic-grid/` is the final magnetic-grid root. `src/lib/grid-engine/` is neither a destination nor an allowed dependency of the final package. T0 must classify every tracked artifact and resolve the active-lane precedence gate before any deletion is authorized. Reuse is **kernel reuse only**: proven function bodies move inward. The old spec values, bridge contract, candidate/offer result shapes, registration doctrine, and package manifests are not inherited merely because they exist.

## 4. Non-goals

- No template catalogue driving search.
- No semantic shape names inside compute.
- No scoring or configurable weights.
- No continuous placement sweep.
- No unruled default layout recommendation inside a band.
- No non-semantic geometry-key winner. Co-lawful layouts are returned with stable identities; deterministic ordering is not product selection.
- No fulfilment, manufacturing-order, or cutout-engine migration in this increment.
- No production publication or deletion before the proof and Dan gates.

## 11. Acceptance criteria

### Cut-over

- [ ] Old magnetic-grid authorities and comparison UI are deleted after proof, consumer migration, and Dan's active-lane precedence ruling.
- [ ] Re-export-aware search finds no old public consumer.
- [ ] No old persisted key can configure the new engine.
- [ ] No `panMM`, weights, phase sweep, or `seatMarginMM` residue remains.
- [ ] Documentation describes only current code.

## 12. Risks and gates

| Risk | Required gate |
|---|---|
| Temporary comparison becomes permanent | T5 Dan “proven” immediately releases T6-T8; no open-ended dual runtime |
| Centre rule remains undecided | T6 is a blocking product gate before cut-over |
| Numeric scale or source accuracy hides flap | Exact rational/algebraic witness; adapter uncertainty is evidence, never added allowance |
| Adapter changes the boundary being solved | Law adapter is pass-through; same supplied contour identity feeds solve, display and truth dots |
| Exact solver misses a narrow/branch-changing regime | Exact event enumeration plus mutation fixtures for every event family |
| Exact solver is correct but unusable on mobile | T1b measures the actual supplied contour fixtures on desktop and a physical production-floor phone before T2a; fail redesigns representation, never law |
| Worker serves stale/wrong rung | Request-sequence suite before UI proof |
| Temporary neutral-body clone diverges | Byte-equality fixture against donor during comparison; old provider deleted only at Dan-approved cut-over |
| Over-deletion removes product behavior | Belt and magnet-plan explicitly preserved; kill evidence bar required |
| Cut-over destroys the active v3.2 grid-engine lane | T0 records ownership; Dan's lane-precedence ruling gates every modification/deletion |

## 13. Open decisions — Dan only

1. Final governed-centre rule after comparison evidence.
2. Which bench diagnostics remain visible after cut-over (they do not enter the engine API).
3. Whether any commercial default rung is selected outside the engine; the engine itself returns all lawful rungs.
4. Production handling of co-lawful layout ties; centre ties must be eliminated by the selected total centre law.
5. Lane precedence for the active `src/lib/grid-engine/**` v3.2 rebuild versus v3.5.1 cut-over. Until ruled, v3.5.1 may inventory and design migration only; it may not modify or delete that lane.

Decisions 1-4 do not block T0-T5; they block T6 and final cut-over. Decision 5 does not block read-only T0 or isolated `src/lib/magnetic-grid/` construction, but it blocks any modification, migration, or deletion of the active v3.2 lane.

## 14. Necessity and sufficiency verdict

**Necessity — no unnecessary elements.** The temporary third Law path is explicitly authorized and bounded by Dan's proof/delete gate. Existing Voting/Centre-rules code and worker remain untouched; Law adds only its portable package, pass-through bridge, separate worker and one shell tab. Segment-only exact solving is the smallest complete domain for the supplied contours. Exact offset/centre certification is required because centre is one of the three laws and the current mesh is a measured corruption source; it replaces rather than layers over that mesh. The focused compute internals each own a distinct proof domain behind one public surface; they prevent a replacement monolith rather than add public layers. T1b is the smallest gate that can falsify the exact-real representation before product construction; it adds no product surface. No Studio integration, scoring, template catalogue, migration framework or speculative product feature is added.

**Sufficiency — delivers the directive in full.** The contract builds a separate third Law tab enforcing Centre, Wrap and Magnet-quantity scaling over B1-B4; keeps both untrusted comparators untouched through proof; enforces spec/compute/logic/engine/bridge/UI boundaries; constructs centre evidence with exact topology and certified optimality/tie/refusal results; solves the supplied final contour exactly; carries raw lawful ties/refusals; proves worker/cache/runtime fidelity and mobile feasibility; and defers every replacement/deletion until Dan's final live tests. Completion is impossible while a layer leaks, a centre is sampled rather than certified, a law is unproved, a regime can be missed, the exact representation misses its mobile envelope, or the final Dan-approved cut leaves a superseded magnetic-grid authority behind.

**Deslop — deletion remains complete but no longer speculative.** T0 inventories both old families and active ownership before T1 moves code. T7 consumes that manifest in consumer-before-provider order after the lane-precedence ruling. The final state still permits one magnetic-grid authority only; unrelated reusable primitives must move to their true owner rather than preserve a misleading `grid-engine` shell.
