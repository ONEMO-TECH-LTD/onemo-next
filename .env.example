# --- Shopify (Dev Dashboard App: onemo-shop-next) ---

# The app exchanges client_id + client_secret for a short-lived access token (24h).
# There is no static shpat_ token — the app refreshes tokens automatically.

SHOPIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=          # SERVER-ONLY. Same page → Secret (reveal with eye icon). Never expose.

# Storefront API access token is created programmatically via Admin API.
# The app generates this on first run and caches it.
# If you have one already, paste it here to skip the generation step:
