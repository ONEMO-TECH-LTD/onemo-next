# Plan First (Brainstorm Mode)

**DEC APM-54 — HARD RULE:** Never execute structural or organizational changes without planning first. Code implementation with a clear Linear issue = execute. New systems, processes, board reorganization, naming conventions = plan first.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Understand the Problem
Ask Dan (or restate) the actual pain point. Not the solution — the problem.
- What's confusing or hard to find?
- What does the ideal experience look like?
- What tools/views is Dan already using?

### Step 2 — Propose Options (2-3 max)
Present concrete options. For each:
- What it looks like in practice (show, don't describe abstractly)
- Tradeoffs
- What Dan would need to do differently

Keep it conversational. No walls of text. Dan thinks fast — match his pace.

### Step 3 — Dan Picks (or Remixes)
Wait for Dan's choice. He might combine ideas or go a different direction. That's the point.

### Step 4 — Confirm Before Executing
Restate the plan in one short paragraph. Get a "yes" or "go" before touching anything.

### Step 5 — Execute
Now do it. Fully. Update Linear, create labels, rename things, whatever the plan requires.

## Anti-Patterns (Things Kai Must NOT Do)

- ❌ Execute a new system without discussing it first
- ❌ Present a single "I already did this" solution
- ❌ Dump 4+ options with long pros/cons lists — Dan doesn't want a menu, he wants a conversation
- ❌ Over-explain things Dan already understands
- ❌ Assume Dan's pain point — ask if unsure

## When to Skip This Skill

- Linear issue with clear acceptance criteria → just execute
- Dan says "just do it" or "execute" → go
- Routine operations (status updates, handoff, session protocol) → no planning needed
