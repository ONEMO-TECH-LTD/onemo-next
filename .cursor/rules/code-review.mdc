# Code Review (ONEMO)

Before committing or marking work ready in this repo, **run the ONEMO code review skill**: invoke `/review` (or say "run ONEMO code review") and report pass/fail and any issues. Use full review for pre-commit/PR; quick scan during development.

The skill can also be triggered **independently** anytime by the user: `/review`, `/code-review`, or "run the ONEMO code review" — use it when asked even if this rule didn’t fire.
