# Git Rules — ONEMO Project

## NEVER do these automatically:
- NEVER run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or `gh pr create`
- NEVER stage, commit, or push changes — Dan reviews diffs in Cursor and commits manually
- NEVER create branches — Dan creates branches via CLI

## What to do instead:
- Make file changes only
- When finished, summarize what changed and stop
- If asked to "commit" or "push", explain what you changed and let Dan do it

## Branch conventions:
- Task branches: `task/<issue-id>-<short-desc>` targeting `staging`
- `main` and `staging` are protected — never push directly

## PR conventions:
- Dan creates PRs via `gh pr create`
- Commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, ci
