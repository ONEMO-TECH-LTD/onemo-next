## RAW values — bind-token worklist
- .m · `font-weight: 500` (css:17)

## REFUSED — design cleanup worklist


## APPROXIMATIONS — lossy-but-deliberate (visible, never silent)
_none — every converted value is exact_

## FONTS USED — must exist in the app build (fallback = silent visual drift)
- Chillax

## TOKEN VALUE PARITY — DS drift (Figma raw vs token resolved at frame width)
_none — every bound token resolves to Figma's own value_

## PAINT PARITY — dropped/flattened fills, strokes & gradients (the non-numeric blind spot)
_none — every visible Figma paint reaches the CSS_

## NATIVE TOKEN CARRIERS — exact source identity in emitted CSS
_none — every supported native property keeps its exact live token_

## SVG DESCENDANTS — live colour carriers and named residual semantics
_none — every exported SVG descendant semantic has a proved live carrier_

## CASCADE AUDIT — full prim→alias→sem chain, both modes
_none — every token bottoms out to a literal in light AND dark_
